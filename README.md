**Keep coding agents faithful to decisions already made.**

> **SOP Control** is a **low-overhead, model-neutral local control plane** for coding agents (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, Cursor). It turns user- and project-defined SOPs into a living repository boundary that agents must follow across tasks, sessions, model switches, and legacy code.
>
> It is not another coding agent or an always-on review bot. The fast path is local and deterministic: constrain the task, intercept unauthorized actions, and run only the checks needed for the current change. Stronger semantic review is an escalation for high-risk work, not a ceremony required for every edit.

## ⚡ The Pain: Decisions Drift, Work Repeats

When a model receives a new session, a new model, or a difficult bug, a decision that was clear to the user can become a suggestion. The cost is not merely a syntax error—it is **unauthorized choice inside an unconstrained ambiguity space**:

### Real Scenario: “Only modify the parser; all data mutations go through `AuditLog`”

* ❌ **Traditional Approach (Prompt-Only Constraints)**:
  * **Practice**: You tell the agent *"only modify the parser; never write directly to the database"* and repeat it in prompts.
  * **The Drift**: A difficult bug makes the agent broaden the file scope, reopen the settled design, skip a workflow step, or repeat an already completed investigation.
  * **Consequence**: Time and tokens are spent on work the user did not authorize. Start a new session or switch models, and the agreement is easy to reinterpret.

* ✅ **SOP Control Approach (Local Control Plane Takeover)**:
  1. **Bind the decision**: A project rule or task contract records what the agent must follow and which files it may touch;
  2. **Project the current boundary**: The relevant control state is compiled into the agent-facing context instead of relying on an ever-longer prompt;
  3. **Intercept the action**: Local hooks and harness checks reject unauthorized writes or workflow skips before they become repository state (zero model tokens);
  4. **Narrow the space over time**: `sopctl audit` and `sopctl growth` surface real bypasses and parallel states; approved cleanup tasks can physically remove them.

```

The control plane grows with the project: it captures settled decisions, projects only the relevant boundary to the current agent, blocks unauthorized actions, and turns repeated ambiguity into human-reviewable cleanup or rule candidates. Observations do not silently become permanent rules; authority remains explicit.

### 1. Decision Fidelity & Task Contracts
When a decision is bound to a task, the agent must follow it even if a later model would choose a different approach. Task contracts specify `allowed_writes` (file write whitelist) and `require_rules`; unauthorized file touches are rejected immediately.

### 2. Boundary Enforcement
Git hooks and harness interception enforce the boundary at the action point. The fast path does not need a second model: local scope, rule, and controller-integrity checks can reject an invalid operation before it changes the repository.

### 3. Real Absorption Auditing (Absorption Audit)
Rules never stay merely on paper. The system uses AST parsers (TS / Go / Rust / Python) to independently verify whether a rule has real production callers (`consumer_markers`) and test coverage (`documented` → `wired` → `wired_and_tested`).

### 4. Model Switch Safety (`task rebind`)
Switching models mid-task often accidentally broadens permissions. SOP Control enforces `task rebind`: permissions for new models **only tighten, never loosen** (taking the most conservative intersection).

### 5. A Living, Measurable Space (Ambiguity Index)
Track repository ambiguity via `sopctl growth measure` (active bypasses + parallel states). Verify that refactoring truly **narrowed** the model's wanderable decision space using `sopctl growth diff`.

### Cost and assurance are separate controls
SOP Control separates cheap enforcement from expensive judgment:

* **Fast path**: local task-scope, rule, hook, and gate checks; no extra model call is required.
* **Normal delivery**: run the tests and audits required by the current task, once at the handoff boundary.
* **High-risk escalation**: add a fresh semantic review only when the risk or uncertainty justifies its cost.

Changing the code or the governing rule invalidates the affected evidence. Unchanged state should not be re-litigated merely because a new chat session has started.

## 📖 What SOP Control Is—and Is Not

SOP Control is:

* a repository-local authority for user and project decisions;
* a boundary that constrains Agent actions and workflow transitions;
* a living space that records where the project is still ambiguous;
* a model-neutral control layer that can sit above Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, or Cursor.

SOP Control is not:

* a coding model or software factory;
* an always-on second Agent that repeats every piece of work;
* a replacement for tests, code review, or human authority on policy changes.

### Terminology Mapping

Here is how SOP Control concepts map to standard engineering terms:

| Project Term | Common Engineering Concept | What Problem It Solves |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Decision Fidelity** | Keeping settled user/project decisions binding for the current task | Prevents silent reinterpretation by a later model or session |
| **Living Control Space** | Tracking active bypasses, parallel states, and unresolved ambiguity | Makes the project's remaining freedom measurable and reducible |
| **Eliminate Ambiguity** | Physically deleting legacy dead code & bypasses | Leaves no physical loopholes for models to bypass rules |
| **Absorption Audit** | Static checks ensuring rules have real code callers | Prevents architectural guidelines from rotting into empty docs |
| **Task Rebind** | Re-aligning permissions to minimum intersection upon model switch | Prevents security degradation when switching models mid-task |
| **Task Contract** | Sandboxed ticket with strict file write whitelists & rules | Prevents agents from altering unrelated infrastructure files |
| **Boundary Gate** | Local hook / harness / CI enforcement at the action boundary | Stops an invalid action before it becomes repository state |
| **Chronicle** | Git-persisted decision log of rules and invariant changes | Explains "how we got here" to the next developer / model session |

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Option A: 2-Minute Minimal Demo

Experience a local physical gate blocking an agent violation without setting up a full project or another model:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mixxmax/sopcontrol.git && cd sopcontrol
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
sopctl gate examples/minimal
```

---

### Option B: Progressive Adoption in Your Project (3 Steps)

#### Step 1. One-command attach (preferred) or manual init

```bash
pip install sopcontrol   # or: pip install "git+https://github.com/mixxmax/sopcontrol.git"
cd /path/to/your-app

# Preferred: non-blocking attach (identity + projection + hooks; no auto-accepted rules)
sopctl attach .
sopctl attach-status .
sopctl compat .          # platform / harness / perf budget self-check

# Or manual:
# sopctl init .
sopctl doctor .          # Diagnoses parallel states & open bypasses; outputs next moves
```

#### Step 2. Bind Your First Core SOP

```bash
sopctl rule add --id RULE-001 \
  --statement "Data mutations must go through unified preview_gate" \
  --modality MUST --status proposed \
  --source-ref README.md --consumer-marker preview_gate

sopctl rule accept RULE-001 .
```

#### Step 3. Mount the Boundary & Start a Bounded Task

```bash
# 1. Install pre-push gate hook
sopctl hook install .

# 2. Bind the current decision to a bounded task (restricted to service.py)
sopctl task open . --model claude-3-7-sonnet --objective "Refactor billing logic" \
  --allow src/service.py --require-rule RULE-001

# 3. Agent submits the bounded change; verify only at the handoff boundary
sopctl task submit <TASK-ID> . --changed src/service.py --model claude-3-7-sonnet
sopctl task verify <TASK-ID> .
sopctl task deliver <TASK-ID> .

# 4. Final local/CI gate: the same boundary applies before delivery
sopctl gate .
```
